        With Khaki, you have the option of uploading individual employees and/or
        departments above using the "Add New" buttons.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, you can upload a CSV file or your employees and teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        The file MUST include the header line and be in the following CSV format:
      </p>

      <pre>
  firstName,lastName,email,department
  [FIRST_NAME_1],[LAST_NAME_1],[EMAIL_1],[DEPARTMENT_1]
  [FIRST_NAME_2],[LAST_NAME_2],[EMAIL_2],[DEPARTMENT_2]
      </pre>

      <p>
        Here's an example:
      </p>

      <pre>
  firstName,lastName,email,department
  John,Smith,johnsmith@mycompany.com,Finance
  Bob,Paulson,bobpaulson@mycompany.com,Marketing
      </pre>

      <p>
        Click below, pick your file, and we'll show you a list of errors (if
        there are any) and a list of good records. When there are no errors,
        you'll be able to click "Upload" and Khaki will do it's thing.
        When it's finished, your updated Employees and Departments will appear
        above.
      </p>
